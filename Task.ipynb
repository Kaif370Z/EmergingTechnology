    "The Collatz conjecture, or the \"3n+1 problem,\" is one we're still waiting to see solved. Introduced in 1937 by German mathematician Lothar Collatz, the Collatz conjecture is a seemingly straightforward question with a surprisingly elusive answer. The conjecture posits that if you repeat two simple arithmetic operations, you will eventually end up transforming every positive integer into the number one. The problem is that it has not yet been proven to be true for all integers. Maybe with some number the sequence gallops off into infinity.
